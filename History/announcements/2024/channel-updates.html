  <p>Ok, so I’m gonna explain some stuff below that I discussed on the last stream I did…</p>
  <p>There are going to be some changes with the channel in terms of uploading and content coming soon! I’ll try to keep it as simple as possible.</p>
  
  <h2>[STREAMS]</h2>
  <p>Streams won’t be as frequent as they usually are anymore. What I mean by that is they will be done rarely. For example, right now we’ve been streaming weekly, but it may become a once- or twice-a-month thing—or maybe even less. (Excluding things like sub specials.)</p>
  <p>This is because I’m going to be focusing on videos and more consistent content. This change won’t go into effect right away but will start as soon as I get a new mic, headset, and all that good stuff (likely to be bought in the next month or so).</p>
  <p>Things like live events or cool/important stuff could still be streamed, and some may happen at random times without much notice. If people are really missing the streams, I’ll try to get one loaded up if I have free time. (If a story game good enough for a stream comes around, then I’ll consider doing them weekly.)</p>
  
  <h2>[VIDEOS]</h2>
  <p>With videos, I’m going to try to make it a daily thing, about twice a week if I can. However, if it becomes too tough, I’ll post another update later for a change. This is all being experimented with at the moment! These videos will include story games, horror games, and a variety of other content if I can get it all working.</p>
  
  <h2>[SETUP]</h2>
  <p>Now about my setup—we all know the mic and headset are a bit buggy, lmao. But if the new mic and headset come in and everything is good, then this plan regarding EVERYTHING will go through. If they don’t work, I’ll either change up the plan or work on identifying and solving the problem.</p>

  <h2>[SHORTS]</h2>
  <p>Shorts will still be uploaded as usual and might even become more frequent, potentially daily. This hasn’t been fully confirmed yet, as I’m figuring out how much time I’ll have for videos and editing. (I’ve also been debating hiring an editor.) Shorts will feature more variety but will still include the “build a character” or “getting a better artist than” series.</p>
  
  <h2>[THIS WEEK’S LIVE]</h2>
  <p>As promised, I missed a Rocket League stream this past week, so I’ll make up for it by streaming at <strong>6 PM THIS FRIDAY</strong> (RL). (Yes, I’m feeling much better now!)</p>
  <p>If anything comes up where I need to change ANY of these updates, I’ll let you all know. For the next few weeks, before getting the new setup, I’ll mainly focus on shorts while I wait for the new equipment (which will hopefully work).</p>
  <p>On top of that, any recent series like FNAF Security Breach or Reacting to TWD will be continued.</p>
  <p>Sorry for making this long, but I wanted you all to be updated and aware of what’s going on and what could happen. (I’ll make another post closer to the time IF everything is good with the setup and these changes go into action.)</p>
  
  <h2>LONG STORY SHORT</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Shorts:</strong> Will include more variety.</li>
    <li><strong>Streams:</strong> Will be less frequent (excluding special events).</li>
    <li><strong>Videos:</strong> Will become more consistent (as long as the new mic works).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For the next few weeks while waiting for the mic, content will mainly focus on shorts. Thanks for reading this far, LOL!</p>
