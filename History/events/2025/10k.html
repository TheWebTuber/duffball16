    <p><strong>At likely EITHER 6 PM or 7 PM start, we will be getting on with the 10K SUB SPECIAL!</strong></p>
    <p>I’ve decided to make it a really chill one – one where we can look back at the journey we’ve been on. It could get nostalgic, it could be funny, it could even be cringe! But either way, it’s going to be special.</p>
    <p>This is your chance to celebrate the highs and lows of everything we’ve built together. It’s been a wild ride, and I can’t wait to share it with you all!</p>
    <p><strong>Hope to see you guys there – this is going to be a really special one!!! ❤️</strong></p>
