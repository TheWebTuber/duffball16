Thank you guys so much for this amazing achievement, hitting these numbers always brings a tear to my eye and couldn’t have asked for a more blessed community. Let’s aim for that 30,000 mark next!</p>

Lights, Camera, Action! We made in total 1,350 Uploads together! I never imagined we would EVER make over 1000 at first, but this is just insane! Let’s see if we can get 2000 together on this journey!</p>

Now this is crazy… over 15M Channel views! This is one of my biggest achievements in my opinion, as we were able to get this many people around the globe to tune in with us. We won’t stop here though, we got the 20M mark next!</p>
