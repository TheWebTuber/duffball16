        <p>IT’S FINALLY HAPPENED! (Hopefully, I don’t jinx it somehow, lol)</p>
        
        <p>I am now officially monetized and have partnered with YouTube’s Partner Program! This means even more ways for you to support me as we continue to grow.</p>
        
        <p>Thanks to this partnership, you can now donate through Super Chats during my streams, videos, and shorts. But that’s not all—there’s even more to enjoy!</p>
        
        <p>You can also become a member today, with membership options ranging from as little as £1.99 to £3.99 and £5.99! Each membership level comes with its own unique set of benefits. It’s an amazing way to get more involved and support the channel while enjoying exclusive perks. (These are monthly payments.)</p>
        
        <p>Soon, I’ll also be launching some merch, but that’s a topic for another time. I’m so excited to take this next step with all of you.</p>
        
        <p>Once again, thank you all, my amazing Duffinians, for helping me get this channel to where it is today. But remember, this is only the beginning—we’re just going to keep growing!</p>
        
        <p>Let’s keep this momentum going and make the journey even bigger and better! ❤️</p>
