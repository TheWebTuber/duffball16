  <p>Guys… this hit me deep in the feels.</p>
  
  <p>This channel has honestly been the best thing that’s ever happened to me. A kid with a dream of hitting these numbers would be smiling so damn much right now—it’s honestly got me emotional.</p>
  
  <p>I’m bummed out that I couldn’t record the live reaction because of work, but wow… just wow.</p>
  
  <p>After locking back in and grinding to points I never thought I could reach, I’m realizing that nothing is impossible, and this will grow to even newer heights.</p>
  
  <p>Many, and I mean MANY, people didn’t believe this would work out or that I would even reach this level. But none of this could have been done without you guys, helping me find the motivation to get things done.</p>
  
  <p>I’ve sacrificed many things and disciplined myself to slow down on the things I love doing to get to this point—time, money, even just playing PS or going out. I know that to achieve these goals, I’m going to have to stay strict with myself, and I’ll continue to do so with you guys along the journey. I’ll always keep bettering myself to chase what I love most and dream of most.</p>
  
  <p>Thank you all, truly, from deep within my heart. Up the Duffinians! ❤️</p>
