                <small>Date: April 15, 2025</small>
                Big news for the channel - a brand-new gameplay series is here. I’m diving into the fast-paced team shooter Marvel Rivals. Expect epic matches, deep character builds, and strategic gameplay, all edited with the high quality you’ve come to expect. The first episode premieres later this week, and future parts will include viewer suggestions and community poll choices. It’s not just about winning, it’s about having fun and creating memorable moments together. Stay tuned and let me know your favorite Marvel characters you want to see in action!

                <h1>New Milestone Goal: 30,000 Duffinians</h1>
                <small>Date: April 10, 2025</small>
                Thanks to your amazing support, we recently crossed 20,000 subscribers! Now, our next big goal is to reach 30,000 Duffinians. To celebrate major subscriber milestones, we host special livestream events called The Duffine Tourneys, where more fans can join, engage, and play live with me and the community. It’s a fantastic way to connect, compete, and have a blast together. You can find examples of past Tourneys on the YouTube channel. If you’re already part of the family, thank you - and if you’re new here, now’s the perfect time to jump in and be part of something awesome.

                <h1>Updated Livestream Schedule: Weekend Hangouts</h1>
                <small>Date: April 5, 2025</small>
                After listening to your feedback and reviewing our stream performance, I’ve updated the livestream schedule to be even more consistent. From now on, livestreams will happen every weekend, starting around 6 or 7 PM UK time. Saturdays will usually feature scheduled gameplay, while Sundays are kept flexible for surprise sessions, special guests, or chill streams. Make sure to hit the bell icon on YouTube so you’re always notified when we go live. Come hang out, chat with me in real-time, and be part of the fun!

                <h1>Upcoming Collab: Big Guest Appearance Incoming</h1>
                <small>Date: March 30, 2025</small>
                A very exciting collab is in the works! I’ll be teaming up with a guest gamer who brings a lot of energy and banter to the table. We’re planning chaotic co-op sessions that will test our skills and probably our patience - in the best possible way. These episodes will start dropping in the next couple of weeks. If everything goes well, we might even turn it into a recurring series. Keep an eye on social media and the Community tab for teasers and sneak peeks!

                <h1>Daily Shorts Update: Featuring Viewer Challenges</h1>
                <small>Date: March 20, 2025</small>
                Shorts are a huge part of the Duffball16 experience, and now we’re adding a new twist. One of the two daily Shorts will now feature viewer challenges, memes, or comment suggestions. That means more interaction, more creativity, and your ideas brought to life right on the channel. Whether it's a funny trend, a crazy in-game challenge, or something completely unexpected - I’m ready for it. Submit your challenge ideas in the comments or send them to me on social media. Let’s create epic Shorts together!
